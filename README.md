Process Notes

**Approach**
- Created a simple React + Next.js app.
- Hard-coded VM data in state.
- Used useState to manage VM list and status.
- A single toggle button cycles the status.

**Decisions**
- Used plain CSS for simplicity.
- No backend used; kept it fully static.
- Did not over-engineer. Focused on clarity.

**Tools Used**
- VS Code
- Next.js
- React Hooks (useState)
- AI for initial code snippets (ChatGPT)

**Trade-offs**
- No backend API used to keep scope realistic for a short assignment.
- Status cycling logic is simple, can be expanded later.
